Rebalance and general scripts refit for some Jim Vogan's Heroes 3 WoG maps

Installation instructions for each folder with a map redesign:
1. Get a clean Heroes 3 SoD folder.
2. Install Era 2.46 on top, from here: https://app.box.com/s/7tyemq1vcss9h7bbzbxv
3. Add HD mod old enough to be compatible with Era, version 4.202 RC5 is fine, but can't use much newer than that. HD mod version archive is here: http://mmgames.ru/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=130&Itemid=217&lang=en
4. Install the correct mods. Secondary Skills Scrolling, Bright Flowers (optional, makes flowers prettier), Swords of Night and Day or HiddenSpells - same link as in point 2. Also Turbo WoG if you want faster combat animations, from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1an21yfqr_qluzAJ19HruQ2zmrL05qu2v
Those exe files are just self-extracting archives.
5. Replace contents of h3eraHD/Mods/[map-name]/Data/s folder and the map in h3eraHD/Mods/[map-name]/Maps with the files from this repository. If there is no Maps folder for a mod in this repository, that means there are no changes to the h3m file and you should leave the original map where it is.
6. Make sure the correct mods are enabled. Either in mod manager, which is in h3eraHD/Tools/Mod Manager, or in the file with enabled mods in h3eraHD/Mods. If you add/delete lines to that file, you will enable/disable mods, just like in mod manager. (Top of file corresponds to bottom of the list in mod manager. For example, WoG mod should be on top in the list.txt file and on the bottom in the Mod Manager)
7. In HD launcher, I recommend setting "Souce size" to same as your monitor resolution.
8. Then read the attached readme file (also updated a bit from the version on box).
9. If you're playing Swords of Night and Day, I recommend that you read the first post in this thread just before starting the map to better immerse into the story: http://heroescommunity.com/viewthread.php3?TID=38476
