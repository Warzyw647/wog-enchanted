Changes:
1. give Devoron Eagle Eye, customize his mage guild, give more buildings in town, including castle, capitol, mage guild 5, dwellings 1-6
2. crow quest change creatures only if V&J are still Swordman and Mage
3. arena max fights: grond 6, minotaur 8, gladiators 10
4. arena gladiators max 8 EP, max 3 attack and defense, on top of ladder give Ares 10 attack and defense more than player's bonus
5. Arena Grond Ogres' creature xp level changed to 0/2/4/6/8/10 at Grond level 1/2/3/4/5/6; At level 5 and 6 Ogres have 1 more speed than they used to
6. stone men 10% chance to stone gaze on hit
7. V&J start with 20 hp less, 5 damage less
8. Gnome Ann gives back 2 hp for each puzzle solved
9. Gnome huts after each puzzle solved offer tea or alcohol; 5 gnomes give teas, 1 gives alcohol; accepting tea gives +1 damage; accepting alcohol gives -1 damage
10. Gnome Ann on 'give up' don't check answer, go back to same puzzle next time, on wrong answer delete this Gnome Ann and show next puzzle
11. toned down Leora's starting stats to 7, then 2 on day 2, Devoron's stats up to 13, then 31 from day 2 on
12. storm giants temporarily take away V&J's Hostile Air Immunity
13. Stom Giants have 99% damage spell resistance (including Chain Titan's Bolt damage changed in Battles.erm) instead of Hostile Air Immunity, so better not shoot them with Chain Titan's Bolt because it will bounce back
14. Movement display a little bit more convenient - doesn't need Leora selected, always diaplays just her movement, added and IF:L message to inform about it at day 2 start after story messages. Also displays her max movement (HE:G). On day 1 displays Jenova's movement, starting from day 2 displays Gem's movement.
15. fixed holes in the walls near Devoron't town (walls around garrisons were passable)
16. Changed Maciek Warp Hole to Chris Warp Hole. Chris is associated with bugs in singleplayer community. Likes to do things like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oItX4RRBF8 but can also solve hard riddles, like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3igiwm1YtmA&list=PLYF8cT0Rculjc_ar9SrotcRD4dE2JoNAN
17. EP in Tomb down to 2 per Skeleton fight (given in Battles.erm like for every neutral fight) and 10 for Mummy fight
18. arena wild beasts max 10 EP from side beasts; max 25 EP from central beasts, then only 1 EP per central beast, after that "You've killed so many it's no longer a new experience. And the crowd wants blood", after 10 side beasts killed, need to kill the central one to exit the Arena
19. corrected gnome huts on give up, gave error; and on cancel, display simple message (not yes/no with the gnome's face) and gnomd doesn't leave because the player didn't see the puzzle yet
20. neutral Wraiths on the map give 3 EP in SND_Battles instead of 1 EP in SND_Arena and 2 EP in SND_Battles
21. Lords of Thunder give just 5 EP in SND_Battles instead of 2 in SND_Battles (as all neutral monsters on the map did) and 5 in SND_Passes to work well with double EP bonus
22.Wraiths take away 1 Artifact or 5 HP, Citadel/Castle/Grail in Woodshire protect from this effect. Citadel protects from draining by (weakened) Wraiths stranded in Woodshire area. Castle protects also from draining by Wraiths in Dark Towers and during Dark Moon night attacks. Grail protects also from draining by Wraiths in garrisons near Megathon and when Wraiths find Jalery and Vames in the Dead Zone or beyond it. If Woodshire doesn't protect, then 1 non-special Artifact with lowest number is lost. If there are none, then a special Artifact (Like Equestrian Gloves, Elektrum or Kligon Artifacts) is lost, starting with the weakest/least needed for quests. Combo Artifacts and are ignored. Quest items needed to get the Swords are ignored unless Leora got the Swords. If no Artifact can be lost, Jalery and Vames (all possible V&J creatures) permanently lose 5 max HP. If they have 5 max HP or less, their max HP goes down to 1.
23. Renamed the score bonus towns to "Score Bonus 1" - "Score Bonus 33", banned Grail buildings in them, destroyed and banned Markets and gave them to Blue initially so that the player can't take them for too much extra income, if he town portals there. Banned creature buildings and similar in Blue's and Orange's towns on the Sun and Moon, in case they tried to build something. And cleared their gold and resources daily to make double sure they don't send anything to the player. Checked on another test map that allies' towns don't count in the final score.
24. revised FU86 in SND_Arena for cases of more than 10 EP gained at once, for the purpose of giving the scoring bonus towns
25. Fixed Anome Ann's UN:C replacing of 'Basic' and 'Advanced' in skill names for other Latin-based lanuages. Assumed 1st letter of 'Advanced' is a capital letter A-Z, there are no more capital letters in 'Basic' after the 1st one and the word 'Basic' is no more than about 18 characters long. For example, in Polish, 'Basic' is 'Podstawowy', 'Advanced' is 'Zaawanswany', shortened to 'Zaaw.', so different text lengths and different letters at start. If a suitable capital letter is not found (probable for Chinese), replacement won't happen and the player will most likely see their 'Basic'/'Advanced' text in Gnome Ann'd bonus-giving text boxes in front of the actual text, but nothing else should break.
26. Updated the map's readme file.
27. Added gold text emphasis to the "Dramatis Personae" opening text. Added info to Lord Morrolan's initial text that Artifacts are also basically gone after Wraith attacks.
28. banned Town Portal in Tomb of Imothep, like in Arena - easiest way to prevent messing up inside and outside of the Tomb in scripts and it's not a long way out of the Pyramid
29. Ogres (and the other Ogres, in an event in the forest) in Grond Gauntlet got slow immunity starting with creature level 4 (Gauntlet level 3-6, no innunity on first 2 Grond levels). This is to avoid rerolling Enchanter spell, counting on luck, and instead think how to take less hits
30. Revised script giving bonus towns, now allows for up to 20 EP gain without sipping towns (2 bonus towns). 20 is the max that can happen on the map (Mummy with Gnome Ann's double EP bonus). FU86 doesn't waste Gnome Ann's double EP bonus on calls with argument 0 (made to reset Leora's Exp right after Wild Beast Arena fights and possibly in other places).
31. Moon and Sun Bees count up to 490 (7x70 or 6x80ish), their experience level increased to 10 from 0 and all given Warlord Banners with random effects. Doable, but not always on the 1st try.
32. Bugs and Nightmares in the underground set to grow (unchecked 'do not grow' flag in map editor on the ones that had it).
33. Fire, Water Elementals in Fountains, numbers boosted, Level 10 Creature Exerience plus random Banners
34. Moon Guards and Sun Guards also got level 10 creature experience
35. Moon Guards battle, Selena also negates V&J's Air immunity, like Lords of Thunder (to allow Disrupting Ray and Summon Air)
36. The new vars I used for Wraiths and Arena are v1420-v1429, also defined new functions FU647-FU653
37. If Chain Lightning is cast by anyone other than a Mage, Archmage or Enchanter, reduced damage to 0 and replaced the log text about Chain Lightning damage with "Leora quietly (for a god) laughs at a joke she just remembered.". Done in SND_Battles. This happens when a turn ends with a cast-before-attack summon elemental and Jalery starts the next turn. Then the wrong Chain Lightning happens at start of Jalery's turn. I can't catch this bug in BG0 to prevent the animation, so decided to play around it and at least prevent the damage and replace the text. Bug noticed in battle vs Moon Guards after giving them level 10 experience and temporarily removing Vames' and Jalery's Air Immunity.
38. Reset Skeleton Warrior stats for the battles with Megathon. For the final battle gave everyone on Megathon's side ACE level (except Earth Elementals summoned by Devoron, they are tough enough)
39. Restored Fire Elemental stats (damage) after the fight for the Sword of Day
40. Fire Elementals got Fire Shield Enchantment at all experience levels to make summons in the Sun Guard fight more dangerous.
41. Sun Warriors and Moon Guards removed 'summoned' flag initially, added after battles for the Swords. They leave corpses behind in the fights for the Swords, but the summoned Air/Fire Elementals automatically get the correct creature experience lines. Otherwise I'd have to constantly repair Air/Fire Elementals experience in the fights for the Swords.
42. Leora's multi-casting ability toned down and simplified. Now she can cast again after every ?!BG1, except for BG:A1 of course. That also means only one hotkey-spellcast per creature action (Waiting and Defending also count as actions). Spell hotkey hint text shortened and adjusted accordingly. Flag 200 and variable v51 therefore completely removed. I mean, I did leave them in commented out code in case the new way breaks in some way.
43. Made Gnome Gniles accept both answers Gnarwhal and Gnarwhale
44. Banned quest artifacts in map properties so that they don't fall out of a Dark Tower: Bird of Perception (the Gem from the Pyramid), Pendant of Negativity (Warp Field picture), Vial of Mercury (Ice Water).
45. Arena, Beasts, corrected recognizing the central monster in the function that gives EP and stops the central monster's movement. Creature types 23, 63 and 159 are also recognized as the central monster. This is needed because Chimera's nature is not reset to creature type 81 if it dies from a retaliation.
46. added Compass for the Lightning Maze. Costs 3 months added to the final score time. After right click on tent sleep/wake hero button displays coordinates of the last visited room number (the room that Leora is currently in, or the room from whick she exited into Xanadu or Town Portaled). Uses z799 and v1430-v1432.
47. Added fixed-random selection of Artifacts in Dark Towers. That means the whole infinite sequence of Artifacts available in those locations is rolled at map start. The sequence shouldn't repeat too soon. Most likely won't repeat within any reasonable time.
