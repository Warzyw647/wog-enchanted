DESCRIPTION:

Aeons ago, Devoron made Holes in the Night, through which he summoned creatures of dark matter, to do his evil will. At first, since their matter does not interact with normal creatures, they are of no effect. Slowly, over the years they accrete shells of normal matter. Thus has arrived the reign of Megathon the Destroyer, the first and oldest of these, who feeds on the bodies of men and turns their souls into Wraiths and Vampires. Only the undying will of Fnord the Great prevents him - so far - from crossing the great river.

Fnord cast mighty runes in the course of the river, henceforth known as Silver Rune the Swift, so that sunlight or moonlight reflected off its ripples dispells dark magic. Its shores sparkle with magic as its currents weave the runes.

However, while free men still live north of the river, Megathon rules the south, and has made it a wasteland, with a Dead Zone to mark the edge of his territory. Also, on moonless nights he sends his Wraiths north to seize men and fly them back to his slave pens, to await their grim fate.

Morrolan the Bold, Lord of Woodshire, has grown weary of losing citizens to the Wraiths, and has decided to lead all his warriors and mages south, to find a way through the Dead Zone and attempt to defeat Megathon in his lair, leaving only untrained youths behind. Should he fail, there will be but one last, faint hope: to journey to the Sun and Moon and bring back the Swords of Night and Day!

UPDATE August 2021: More landscaping and features have been added, among them Gnome Ann and her Ann-agrams. If you need spoilers, two of them are shown in GIF files in the main folder. They are not necessary to complete the game but might get you a higher score.

UPDATE September 2025: "Minor changes and fixes" by Warzyw647, including moving scripts from map events to Data/s and balance changes here and there. Gnomes are now much more important. No problems noticed when using Turbo WoG mod instead of Fast Battle Animation.

NOTES ON RUNNING THE MOD

This mod was first created as a custom WoG map, with the custom scripts in the Timed Events section, as was standard then. It was issued as an Era mod when Era 2.4 was new. Later, higher versions of Era (2.5 and above) no longer allowed Timed Event scripts. However, I had stopped installing new Era versions (having previously used Era 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2.2, 2.3, 2.40, 2.41, and 2.46, having to transfer files from previous versions each time and occasionally adjust scripts) since Era 2.46 seemed fine to me, and sufficient. A copy of my Era 2.46 installation file is available in the same Box.com folder whose link is given above. For information on Era installation and use see various posts at Heroes Community, e.g., http://heroescommunity.com/viewthread.php3?TID=37208

To install this mod in an Era 2.4(x) folder, execute the executable archive file (SwordsOfNightAndDay.exe) and browse the target to your Era 2.4 folder (or higher Era version at your own risk).

When running this mod under Era (2.4), the enabled mods should be Swords of Night and Day, and Wog. (Fast Battle Animation is optional also, between SND and WoG.) (Secondary Skills Scrolling could be enable also, but is not necessary.) (The Yona mod should be okay also, but my Era 2.4 versions worked for a while and then stopped working.)

HD mod version archive can be found here (at least it could be found there as of now, September 2025): http://mmgames.ru/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=130&Itemid=217&lang=en
No problems noticed when playing this map with HD mod version 4.202 RC5. This is said to be one of the last few versions that work with Era.
Newer HD mod versions are known to be incompatible with Era.
Playing with HD mod may require changing your Mods/Swords of Night and Day/EraPlugins/XFiles.dll to the one in the box folder. Please refer to the appropriate instruction for this file in the box folder.

Mod Turbo WoG can be found here, in Salamandre's folder with Era mods, as "[Gameplay] Turbo WoG": https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1an21yfqr_qluzAJ19HruQ2zmrL05qu2v
Useful if you like faster animations than the Fast Battle Animations mod provides.

Another recommended mod is a graphical mod Bright Flowers, from the same box archive as this map-mod.

TECHNICAL NOTES (useful for planning strategy):

0. Some battles' difficulty highly depends on the selected game difficulty. On higher difficulties there are more enemies and slightly stronger. On 80% difficulty Leora can cast spells more often than on higher difficulties.

1. Vames and Jalery's experience can be read as the last three digits of Leora's experience, after the first battle which takes place at the end of day one.

2. Killing the Wandering Monster in the Arena is worth 3000 gold, which you may need, but every time one is killed, the experience level of all Arena beasts goes up by two. After 10 beasts killed, the audience wil get boredof that. After 5 Wandering Monster kills, the crowd will get slightly bored of that (EP gains reduced).

3. The Hit Points of the Arena beasts are increased by (V&J's Experience Points) divided by two, then divided by the number of creatures per troop.  This is done before the troop count is increased, if 4 applies.  Also their damage increases by (Experience Points)/10.

4. The number of creatures (per troop) in the Arena is doubled after Vames or Jalery's first promotion* (see footnote), and is triple the original number after the second promotion.  Vames becomes a Senior Warrior at 50 Experience Points (if he visits the Warrior Training Center at that point), and an Elite Warrior at 100 Experience Points.  Jalery becomes a High Mage at 60 EP at the Mage Training Center, and an Enchanter at the MTC after he is a High Mage and earns Tim's ring.  (There are non-promotional bonuses at the TC's for other EP values.)  The Sun and Moon Temples in Xanadu will give other bonuses for Experience Points over 149.  The game score will increase based on EP also.
* promotion status is checked for stack zero only, so if V and J have different numbers of promotions, whichever has the lower troop slot will determine the enemy bonuses.

5. The Ogres in the Gauntlet have an increase in damage of two after each successful Ascension Ceremony.

6. The experience level of the Ogres increases by two for each win in the Gauntlet.

7. The Minotaur in the Labyrinth starts at experience level 3, and gains one level for each win by V & J.  It gains +2 Attack and Defense and +1 Speed for every promotion that stack zero has.

8. There are extra prizes for 3 and 6 wins in the Gauntlet and 4 and 8 wins in the Labyrinth.

9. There are seven rungs in the Gladiator Ladder.  There is an additional bonus for reaching the top.

10. You will need 25 wood, and 10 of each other resource except gold and mithril to obtain all of Qubit's information. You will need 25000 gold to buy a liter of Electrum from a Storm Giant.

11. As Qubit gives hints, the places he describes are revealed on the map (darkness removed).

12. The Lightning Maze is a 6x10 maze of cells, randomly distributed over the 60 cells of the lightning bolt (as seen in the mini-map).  You will probably need to map it to navigate it quickly.  A template for mapping (MazeMap) is included in this package, as a PDF and as an Excel spreadsheet.  Also, an enclosed GIF illustrates the mapping process. (The maze changes each time a new game is started.) Since you will be moving one step at a time, the arrow keys are the best way to move.

13. Wind Up: once you are in the big Arena or the Lightning Maze and have some remaining movement, it is intended that you will not have to stop moving until you exit those places. Therefore, while moving there additional movement points are added (up to a high limit) at each step, and the total accumulated movement points may allow you to move long distances in the same turn when you exit those places. (Depending on how much movement you do inside to "wind up" movement points.

14. Do not select an artifact as your starting bonus for the game - you will lose it, due to the ill-fated Morrolan expedition.

15. If you lose your First Aid Tent, you can buy a new one at the Marketplace in Woodshire (but it will only be offered if you don't have one and have 200 gold).

16. Right-clicking the Horse "continue movement" icon on the Adventure Map will display Leora's movement.

17. Gnome riddles are fairly important, so do your best there.

18. The preferable methods of casting spells in combat are with hotkeys and by pressing the hero-on-horse picture. The spellbook icon and the 'c' shortcut will not always respond.
